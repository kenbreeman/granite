# Granite
Rock-solid security above all else.

Granite is a hardened variant of Linux meant to be used as a single-purpose virtual machine image for security sensitive applications.

## Goals

Granite aims to be as secure as possible at the expense of performance, usability, maintainability, uptime, etc.

## Status

Nothing is set in stone yet. Granite is currently in the design phase: things will change often, things will break often, pull requests welcome!

## Implementation

Granite is based on [Gentoo Hardened](https://wiki.gentoo.org/wiki/Project:Hardened) and utilizes [Packer](https://www.packer.io/intro/index.html) to build virtual-machine images.

## Why?

Because it isn't paranoia if they're really out to get you.
